<p>It's important to be able to see your system's energy production and know why it is over- or under-producing. Much like the weather, it's difficult to predict, but - using weather patterns and data from the U.S. Department of Energy (via NREL) - we are able to determine estimated energy yields.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can play into why your system is producing more or less than expected, which is why we try to be conservative when estimating how much energy a system will produce. Systems tend to underproduce their expected yields in the winter, and overproduce in the summer. During the winter, we have shorter days (meaning less sun) and can also have snow cover. The opposite is true in the summer: instead we have longer days, and no snow.</p>
