<p>When comparing your solar-energy system's current production to previous years', you will always see variance: no two days are exactly the same when it comes to weather, let alone years. And variances in weather year-to-year can have a profound effect on levels of energy production.</p>
<p>For example, if last February was brutally cold and you experienced heavy snows, chances are that solar production was low for that month. If, in contrast, this year's winter has been milder, then you'll most likely see a significant bump in production when comparing month-over-month (Feb vs Feb).</p>
<p>Its important to remember that when comparing one month or year to another that although there may be short-term peaks and valleys, the longer your system is on, the closer to its expected production it gets. The estimated yields may not look accurate on a day-to-week or even month basis, but when you compare years, it begins to be much more predictable.</p>
